# Linux-Projects
In this directory, I will be updating my Linux projects and how I did them. I first started using Linux on a Virtual Machine created on my windows computer.
I am currently using Ubuntu and getting familiarized with the amazing "terminal world."

* First Project
  
   - Create a Virtual Machine on my Windows computer using Oracle VM Virtual Box.
  - Download and install Linux Ubuntu 20.04.2.0 LTS (latest version at the time of installation).
  
* Second Project

  - Raspberry Pi 4 projects
  
    - Install Linux Ubuntu 20.04.2.0 LTS on a Raspberry Pi 4 8gb ram
    - Install Pi-Hole ad blocker to work on all devices in my home network
    - Install Wireguard VPN and add clients for all my devices and computers
