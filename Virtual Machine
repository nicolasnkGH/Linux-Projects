Virtual Machines are utilized to run others operating systems "inside" of your computer. This new created operating system will behave 
as a separate computer and will not affect the functionality of your existent OS. This technique is used when you want to experiment
new OS or test new developed apps and programs in a safer environment which will not affect your main operating system.

I will not be covering here step-by-step on how to do the whole process, although I will provide the links for download of the
necessary tools.

For my project, I utilized a software called Oracle VM Virtual Box. Below, you can find the link to download the software. Make sure
to also download the Extension packs on the same page.

I then Installed Linux Ubuntu 20.04.2.0 LTS (latest version at the time of installation).

The installation is pretty straight forward and if needed, several tutorials can be found on the internet.
